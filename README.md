# Intro

The chef_python cookbook is a non-POISE cookbook to install and manage Python.

The original Python cookbook has been deprecated in favor of a POISE flavored Python cookbook. This project exists for those that want to run a Python cookbook but don';t subscribe to the architecture used in the POISE flavored Python cookbook. Since no PRs are being accepted to the Python cookbook, I've created this one as the Python cookbook moving forward.
